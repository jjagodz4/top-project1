# top-project1

This project is a simple landing page using HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project foundations curriculm. 

The first steps taken were to develop the main foundation of the page using HTML. The page consists of five sections - hero, call to action, information, quote, and footer. 

A diagram (using draw.io) was created to outline the different sections the wesbite will contain. This will help with visualizing containers and items when using flex to format the site in the CSS stylesheet. 

Created a CSS stylesheet to format and stylize the site. Flex is a large component of the site.



Journaling 
03 AUG - Created README.md file and index.html skeleton. 
04 AUG - Created draw.io diagram to display how site will be designed. The diagram helps me visualize how containers fit with each other to input Flex variables in the CSS stylesheet. Updated index.html to include different placeholder from the sections in the diagram. Create style.css to begin formatting and styling the site. Started with header and hero sections. Still working on making sure Flex properties are properly configured to achieve desired results. Troubleshooting hero content and hero image to make sure site maintains appropriate proportions.
